I initially did not ask it for proper documentation, so that explains the reason for the AI giving the bare minimum in regards to
the amount of info it returns. While it gives the bare minimum to explain what it is doing, its clearly just that, the bare minimum.

The mathematical formulas all check out, and all the tests showed full success in testing each of the given shapes.

In hindsight, a couple follow-up iterations could have been helpful to clear the air in some places, such as the aforementioned
method comments.

One thing that is helpful to an extent is that since the code has few iterations, the AI has less backtracking to do to cover
all prior info, which kept the coding convention similar throughout

I tested a couple edge cases, I could have tested more though, and was content to see it simply state I was putting in
invalid answers or answers that were too large and move on.
